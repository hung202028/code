## Intent
> The Builder pattern is useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

## Example
> One of the best applications of the Builder pattern is an SQL query builder. The builder interface defines the common steps required to build a generic SQL query. On the other hand, concrete builders, corresponding to different SQL dialects, implement these steps by returning parts of SQL queries that can be executed in a particular database engine.
