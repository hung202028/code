## Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction
process can create different representations.

## In plain words

> Allows you to create different flavors of an object while avoiding constructor pollution. Useful
> when there could be several flavors of an object. Or when there are a lot of steps involved in
> creation of an object.
