## Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes.


## Explanation

Real-world example

> To create a kingdom we need objects with a common theme. The elven kingdom needs an elven king, elven castle, and elven army whereas the orcish kingdom needs an orcish king, orcish castle, and orcish army. There is a dependency between the objects in the kingdom.

In plain words

> A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.
