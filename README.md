## PHP Code
The motivation of this project is to refresh
the fundamental knowledges:

> 1. Data structures and algorithms  
> 2. Software design patterns


#### Why PHP ?
> 1. PHP is flexible enough to manually implement common
> data structures and solving leetcode's style questions.
> There are built-ins data structures come in handy:
> SplStack, SplQueue, SplPriorityQueue, SplDoublyLinkedList,...
> For the heap data structure, while most other languages don't 
> have built-in heap or only have min-heap (or max-heap), PHP has both
> SplMinHeap and SplMaxHeap, so we can use min-heap and max-heap
> separately without having to worry about using either data structure
> by mistake.
> 
>
> 2. Althouth PHP is not fully object-oriented but 
> its oop features are good enough to demonstrate oop patterns
> ...and more. PHP has "interface" while python doesn't have and the
> same oop code in PHP is a lot shorter than the same oop code in Java.
